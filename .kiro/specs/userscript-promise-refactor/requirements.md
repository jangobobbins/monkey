# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Refactor the Facebook Group Poster userscript to replace setTimeout-based scheduling with promise-based async/await patterns for better code readability and maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace setTimeout with promises so that the code is more readable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script executes automated actions THEN it SHALL use async/await with promise-based delays
2. WHEN delays are needed THEN the system SHALL use a centralized delay utility function
3. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all existing functionality SHALL remain unchanged

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want predictable timing logic so that delays are easy to understand and modify.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the doActionsForGroup function executes THEN it SHALL be converted to an async function
2. WHEN the replayAll function executes THEN it SHALL handle async operations for multiple groups
3. WHEN errors occur during async operations THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully
